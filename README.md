This repository contains the complete documentation for a modular robot controller node, designed for use in multi-joint robotic arms. Each board controls a single motor controller, communicates over a daisy-chained RS3485 network, and is powered through a shared 24â€¯V supply.

This document is intended as a technical reference during development, debugging, and integration. It provides detailed information on pinouts, alternate functions, and all key hardware features of the board.
